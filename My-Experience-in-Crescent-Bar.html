                <h3>The Beach</h3>
                <p>Going to the beach was one of my favorite activities while in Crescent Bar. My grandparent's trailer
                    was
                    only a few hundred feet from the beach, so some days would be spent almost entirely at the beach.
                    There
                    were also other beaches nearby that we frequently visited. My seconf cousin Kelsey and her parents
                    also
                    had a trailer at Crescent Bar, so we would go to the beach that was close to her house too. That
                    beach
                    had a rope swing attached to one of the trees that hung over the water, so we had a ton of fun
                    swinging
                    out into the water from the rope swing.</p>

            <div class="three">
                <h3>The Pool</h3>
                <p>Staying at the resort in the trailer gave us access to the community pool at Crescent Bar. This was
                    another place that we frequently went while staying at Crescent Bar. The pool at Crescent Bar holds
                    a
                    lot of memories for me, as it was the pool I learned to swim in. My family would spend hours at the
                    pool, playing games, and relaxing on the lounge chairs on the poolside.</p>

                <h3>Biking and Scootering</h3>
                <p>The trailer park at Crescent Bar had almost a grid of roads, while staying there we loved to ride our
                    bikes and scooters through the streets. Crescent Bar is where I learned how to ride a bike. My
                    sister
                    and my favorite place to ride bikes or scooters was a smaller loop of the resort called south park,
                    this
                    was because the roads here had been most recently paved and the smooth ground was nice for riding.

                <h3>The Fourth of July</h3>
                <p>Every summmer my family would be at Crescent Bar during the Fourth of July. There was a parade and
                    firework show every year. A couple of times I was in the parade, but in years I wasn't we would
                    always
                    bring our camp chairs and watch the parade go by. But my favorite part of the holiday was the
                    firework
                    show. Everyone would bring camp chairs or blankets out to the golf course and watch the firework
                    show.

                <h3>The Trailer</h3>
                <p>Although we would spend most of our time in Crescent Bar outside, I loved my grandparent's trailer
                    too.
                    The trailer had a large deck that we would often eat dinner on, we would also play board games and
                    card
                    games into the night on the deck. The trailer also had a large yard that my family would play many
                    games
                    on. From croquet and volleyball, to running through the sprinklers and soaking up the sun. Often
                    times
                    when staying in Crescent Bar it wasn't just my immediate family, but my aunts, uncles, and cousins
                    would
                    be there too. When the whole family was there we would bring our Rv and park in the driveway, and
                    the
                    kids would set up tents in the yard so that we would have space for everyone. </p>

                <h3>The Shops</h3>
                <p>Another thing that became a tradition for us duirng each trip to Crescent Bar was going to the
                    different
                    shops and restaurants. There was an ice cream parlor called island cup and cone, my sister and would
                    get
                    the flavor cotton candy everytime. We also made it a tradition to go to the pizz parlor, Tower Pizza
                    once per trip. Some of the other shops that we went to included the corner store, and the swimsuit
                    shop.

                <h3>Boating</h3>
                <p>One of my favorite aspects of going to Crescent Bar was boating. When we went boating we would ride
                    out
                    to a beach called "the dunes" because it was a small beach with large sand dunes. This was a very
                    popular spot for people with boats or jetskis to go. When at the dunes my siblings and I would race
                    to
                    see who could make it up to the top of the dunes first. This was a challenge because the sand was so
                    hot
                    it would start to burn your feet before you could get to the top. Often times my family would pack
                    lunch
                    and enjoy the day at the dunes. We would play water games, go skiing, inner tubing, and wake
                    boarding.
