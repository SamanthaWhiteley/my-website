            What was nearby
        </h2>
        <h3>The Ice Cream Parlor</h3>
        <p>
            There was an ice cream parlor that was just outside of the gates to the resort called Island Cup and Cone.
            When visiting Crescent Bar my family would come to the ice cream shop at least once during each trip.
            My sister and I loved the flavor cotton candy, and we would get the same thing every time.
        </p>
        <h3>The Golf Course</h3>
        <p>
            There was a golf course in Crescent Bar and they had a golf shop next to the ice cream shop as well.
            My Grandpa loved to golf and would spend all day on the course when he was staying at Crescent Bar.
            Not many other people in my family visited the course very often.
        </p>
        <h3>The Convenience Store</h3>
        <p>
            There was a little store that had mostly snacks, but you could get some essentials here as well.
            If you wanted to go to an actual grocery store you would have to drive up to Quincy, a nearby town to the
            grocery stores there.
        </p>
        <h3>
            The Pizza Parlor
        </h3>
        <p>
            There was a pizza shop called Tower Pizza.
            My family and I would go to this pizza shop at least once per trip to Crescent Bar.
        </p>
        <h3>The Swimsuit Shop</h3>
        <p>
            There was a small shop that sold bathing suits on the corner.
            My sister and I would always want to look at what they were selling, and our second cousin Kelsey worked
            there over the summer for a couple of years.
