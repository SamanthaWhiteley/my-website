1. I need to consolidate my css code so that I don't have duplicate code. 
This will also make it easier to make changes to my code.

I created a new file for my nav bar in css so that I don't have duplictae code.
I also created a css folder to put all my css files into so that I am more organized.

2. My places to stay page is too wordy, and not visually appealing.

I fixed this page by creating cards for each place to stay, and reduced the word count a lot.

3. On the my experience page my pictures look off, they are not centered.

I centered the pictures, so now the web page looks a lot better.
